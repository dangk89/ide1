        This infographic contains an abundance of information. It is able to
        capture both the destinction between municipality/region elections,
        geographical dispersion and vote distribution. Using a map to display
        the actual municipalities and colour codes to signal the overall results
        of the individual locations, without the user having to navigate into
        details. By clicking and interacting on the map, a view
        of regions, municipalities and later constituencies, explains the vote
        distribution with a high degree of detail. Especially the historical
        comparison (percentage- and candidate-wise) is useful for putting the
        information in context. On the negative side it contains a lot of
        information that inevitable is confusing to navigate. It is also a
        little sluggish, discouraging the user to thoroughly interact with all
        levels in the visualisation.

    <p>I work with neuromorphic computation and machine learning, and through
    that data with a high degree of complexity. I often get the feeling that
    I miss important correlations and hard-to-see causalities, simply because
    the data is difficult to intuit about. Focusing on the neuromorphic part,
    I would get the data from the Human Brain Project, who are currently storing
    terrabytes of data on neural connections and neural models of humans, rats
    and mice.</p>
    <p>To begin with it would be interesting to visualise some of the
    connections of the different brain modules, to underline
    the complexity of the domain. The story of such a visualisation would focus
    on giving the user an understanding of the diffent areas of the brain, how
    they are connected and potentially how they work. This would bring some
    of the at times inaccessible information to a broader audience. But the
    primary audience would be the researchers associated with the project, to
    help them visualising information to shed light on otherwise hidden
    aspects of the data.</p>
